##workstation cookbook
This cookbook should ease my transition between work stattions and help me to centralize my content ( other stuff will go in private repos) in case of failure.

-python 2.7 + setup tools/pip

#### gems:
- knife-rackspace ( knife plugin)
- knife-docker (knife plugin)

##### python modules:

- that other cli

Configs to bring along:
